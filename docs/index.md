# Semester Statistics

A project meant to keep an updated record of all scores achieved.

This was started off as a Project to maintain all existing Scores recieved from VTU.

This is a Flexible Data Project that does not require Special Functions as dictated by any college.

Please note that there will be many Changes That can happen Before.
